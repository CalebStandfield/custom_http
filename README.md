# Custom HTTP Server in Rust

This project is a custom HTTP/1.1 server written from scratch in Rust.  
The goal is to explore how a real web server works internally by implementing the full stack manually — from socket management to concurrency and asynchronous I/O.

It builds directly on what I learned from *The Rust Programming Language* book and extends those ideas into a larger, real-world system.
Especially concurency and asynchronous programming.

## Overview

The server is designed around three main goals:
1. Use **concurrency primitives** from Rust’s standard library to handle multiple connections safely.
2. Build a **custom thread pool** to manage worker threads and prevent thread-per-connection overhead.
3. Add **asynchronous I/O** for low-latency, non-blocking file serving.

The final result is a small but capable HTTP server that can serve files, handle concurrent requests, and demonstrate how modern web servers achieve performance through parallelism and event-driven I/O.

## Architecture
forgive me if this looks like a child made it. 

    src/ 

      main.rs
      
      server.rs
      
      thread_pools.rs
      
      utils.rs
      
      io/
      
        file.rs
        
        nonblocking.rs
        
      https/
      
        headers.rs
        
        request.rs
        
        response.rs

Each component is written to be clear and self-contained, without `mod.rs` files (mostly cause I hate them and think they are outdated, but thats a discussion for later). The design is meant to keep things seperate and thus navigatable :)

## Technical Focus

- **Thread Pool Architecture** – Fixed-size pool with a job queue for efficient scheduling.  
- **Event-Driven I/O** – Uses `mio` for readiness-based I/O instead of blocking sockets.  
- **HTTP Parsing** – Minimal but compliant request/response handling.  
- **File Serving** – Efficient static file delivery with buffering and MIME detection.

## Stack

- Rust 1.91+     (I actually don't know, thats just what I have rn) 
- `std::thread`, `std::sync`
- [`mio`](https://crates.io/crates/mio)
- [`mime_guess`](https://crates.io/crates/mime_guess)

## Purpose

This is in no way shape or form meant to replace an existing framework or library — it’s just an exercise in understanding what happens beneath them. By implementing concurrency, scheduling, and I/O from first principles, I'll be able see how performance and correctness interact in low-level systems programming, which is currently what I'm intrested in and would like a bit more practice in.
