//! Implementation of a thread pool.
//!
//! Note that this implementation is based off The Rust Programming Language book.
//! Almost all the code is similar or the same to the book.
//!
//! When I learn more about Rust, I will come back and see if I can change things to make them better.
//! Or completely rewrite this code.
//!
//! However, as the book is the only placed I've learned rust from,
//! it is inevitable that this first version would basically be identical to the book... :(
